# Image Recognition Game bypass

This is just a source code for the program, but does not contain the full code since it was meant to be a reference to other project that are looking for something similar and how to implement it.
## Pre-requisite install:
- Python
- Visual Studio Code for editing code / Pycharm (IDE program is written in.)
